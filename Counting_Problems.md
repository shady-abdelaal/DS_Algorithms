#Solving Counting Problems with Python

In this tutorial, we are going to discuss some tips and tricks to solving counting problems with Python. First through the basic, standard python data structures
and then with the more advanced counter module.

Counting problems are a category of "problem solving" where you are faced with the problem where you need to keep track of the count of different stream of data. 
For instance, let's have a look at this problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/ . Where, given a string, we need to
sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters. For example: Input: "tree" , Output: "eert".
Another example: given a file which represents an internet browser history for the last month. Return the 10 most visited websites sorted along with the number of visits
for each.
