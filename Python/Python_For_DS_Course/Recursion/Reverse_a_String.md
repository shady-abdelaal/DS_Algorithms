Reverse a String
This interview question requires you to reverse a string using recursion. Make sure to think of the base case here.
Again, make sure you use recursion to accomplish this. Do not slice (e.g. string[::-1]) or use iteration, there muse be a recursive call for the function.
Solution
In order to reverse a string using recursion we need to consider what a base and recursive case would look like. Here we've set a base case to be when the length of the string we are passing through the function is length less than or equal to 1.
During the recursive case we grab the first letter and add it on to the recursive call.

```python
def reverse(s):
    
    # Base Case
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return s

    # Recursion
    return reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]
```
